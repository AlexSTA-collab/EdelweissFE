class FieldVariable:
    """This is a basic field variable, tied to a spatial position.
    Currently, it is a placeholder used to indicate the presence field variables at a certain location, and associate them with e.g, nodes.
    Furthermore, it allows us to adress them by their unique id (= hash value).
    Unlike ScalarVariables, FieldVariable does not directly holds any results/values, but rather, for perfromance reasons,
    we store results in cumulative Fields, such as NodeField.
    FieldVariable only holds a reference to the primary NodeField results.
