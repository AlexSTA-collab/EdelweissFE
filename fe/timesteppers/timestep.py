        This is the representation of a time step in a simulation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        number
            The consecutive number of this TimeStep.
        stepProgressIncrement
            The relative increment within the current loading step.
        stepProgress
            The total relative progress within the current loading step.
        timeIncrement
            The time increment within the total simulation time.
        stepTime
            The current time in the step.
        totalTime
            The total time.
